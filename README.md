===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

Running the game
================
Visit the index.html file in your browser.

Playing the game
================
The goal of the game is to move the player at the bottom of the board to the
water at the top of the board, while avoiding the enemies.

Use the arrow keys to move the player around the board.  If the player comes
into contact with an enemy, the game is lost and the player is moved back to the
start position.
